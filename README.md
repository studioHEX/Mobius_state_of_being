# Mobius_state_of_being

Mobius State of Being is a meditative performance. During the performance the performer wears a Muse headband that measures realtime brainwaves. When a meditative state is being reached the alpha brain waves are being directly sonified into a low rumble starting at 0 Hz and peaking at 100 Hz. The higher the amount of alpha waves the higher the pitch of the rumble. This rumble is not only a illustration of the brainwaves and the reaching of meditative state it is also used as an exciter for the accoustic resonances inside the room where the performance takes place.

The work is heavily inspired on Alvin Lucier’s “I am sitting in a room” and “Vessels” and also combines elements of other works of studio Hex like Witte Zwanen and Norns, building upon fascinations and earlier conducted research.

Mobius State of Being uses accoustic resonance to build a force field of sound through live generative auditive feedback. During the performance the audience is asked and invited to move around within this forcefield to block or reflect traveling soundwaves which will change the audible landscape of sound.

Within the work there are several layers of storytelling being active. On one hand it is a story about the performer becoming one with the room, by going deeper into his interior the exterior transforms into a representation of himself. Because of the forcefield and the audience being invited into it it also becomes a play between the performer and the audience. The more they move around the more the performer is distracted and therefore the performance weakens. But at the same time the more the audience moves around the higher the influence on the narrative is present.
